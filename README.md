Text Summarisation using Pre-trained Large Language Models


Overview:
This project explores the fine-tuning of two pre-trained large language model on a text summarisation task. The models are fine-tune each on a small subset of the SCiTLDR, and SAMsum dataset. Each model after fine-tuning is evaluated using the ROUGE metric for evaluating machine generated text.

Dataset:
The SAMsum and SCiTLDR datasets are downloaded from hugging face.

Files:
The notebook file contains all the experiments performed and you can run the code to download the models from hugging face.
